# os-dev
Stuff developed based on https://wiki.osdev.org

This repository contains stuff I've developed for a hobby OS.

Inspired by https://github.com/sphaerophoria/stream-os.git

I'll try to design a structured OS in the future, currently I'll be implementing
whatever seems interesting/fun. Only real goals:

- Get it to run on real hardware
- Make it as modular as possible
- Learn!

A journal of each achievement for this toy OS can be found in JOURNAL.md
